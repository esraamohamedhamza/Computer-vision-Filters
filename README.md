# Filters-Computer-vision. 

 Explain the difference between different types of filters and their effect on the picture. 

I use gusain filter, blur filter, kernel 2D filter, sobel filter and invert filter. 

- The Gaussian blur :is the softest blur effect you can apply and is a frequently used blur effect. By default, this filter affects the image uniformly, although you can control the amount of horizontal and vertical blur independently. 

- Blur filter:kernel de-emphasizes differences in adjacent pixel values. The emboss kernel (similar to the sobel kernel and sometimes referred to mean the same) givens the illusion of depth by emphasizing the differences of pixels in a given direction.

- Kernel 2D Filter: is a type of Kernel-based smoothing method which is often applied to an input vector, time series or matrix to generate the smoothed version of the input sequence. A specific type of kernel is used for the smoothing process.

- Sobel filter: is used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges.

- Inverse Filter: Inverse Filtering is the process of receiving the input of a system from its output. It is the simplest approach to restore the original image once the degradation function is known.
